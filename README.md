# Rtool-Grouping-doors

A simple tool that allows you to combine doors for Darkrp.
A simple tool that allows you to combine doors for Darkrp. Buying all the doors to the room is long and tedious, but thanks to the Tool, you can combine the doors so that players can buy the entire group of doors with one button.

If the main owner of the door sells the doors, then the ownership of the door is inherited by other users if they are added as co-owners. This can be disabled in the settings, then if the main owner sells the door, then the co-owners will also cease to own the doors.

If you use falco prop protection or another similar addon, you must allow admins to use the tool on blocked entities.
